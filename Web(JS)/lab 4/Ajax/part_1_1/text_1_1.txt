   One, indeed, needs very little:
   Look and find it in the end.
   To begin with, one needs people:
   just one foe
   and just
   one
   friend.
  
   One, indeed, needs very little
   Just a path to take one's leave,
   and one's wish is very simple
   He just wants
   his mom
   to live.
  
   One, indeed, needs very little:
   peace that follows stormy days.
   Just some fog and stars that twinkle,
   just
   one life
   and just one death.
   
   One just needs a morning paper,
   With mankind the kinship bonds.
   Just one planet, love and favour,
   Mother Earth!
   That's all one wants.
 
   Plus
   an interstellar road and
   dream of flying and high speed.
   That's a trifle, not important,
   That's not very much, indeed.  
  
   Not a big award and wholly
   negligible podium.
   One
   does not need much
   if only
   he'd be waited for
   at home.
