The jQuery load() method is a simple, but powerful AJAX method.
The load() method loads data from a server and puts the returned data into the selected element.
The required URL parameter specifies the URL you wish to load.
The optional data parameter specifies a set of querystring key/value pairs to send along with the request.
The optional callback parameter is the name of a function to be executed after the load() method is completed.
